# Plan

Here are a series of tasks I could tackle to build up to the task of identifying a person by their voice.

1. Binary classification: male or female *
2. Multi classification: could we predict more?? e.g. age, nationality
3. Binary classification: is this person X, or not?
4. Multi classification: who is X?

*Please do not cancel me. This is NOT a statement on the topic of gender classification, rather male vs female was the simplest distinction to begin with for classifying based on vocal characteristics.
